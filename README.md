# Speed Up <i>All Pairs Similarity Search (APSS)</i>

## Introduction

 Given a large collection of sparse vector data in a high dimensional space, the All pairs similarity search (APSS) or self-similarity join is the problem of finding all pairs of records that have a similarity score above a given threshold. Similarity between two records is defined via some similarity measure, such as the cosine similarity or the Tanimoto coefficient. APSS is a compute-intensive problem. 

## Problem Statement

The problem tackled in this project is called Min-𝜖 Cosine 𝑘-Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction, and is defined as follows.
Given a set of objects 𝐷, for each object 𝑑i in 𝐷, find the 𝑘 most similar other objects 𝑑j with cosine similarity cos(𝑑i,𝑑j) of at least 𝜖. In this project, the problem must be solved exactly, i.e., all correct neighbors must be reported, along with their correct cosine similarities.

A baseline method, using IdxJoin, has been provided by Prof. David C. Anastasiu, implemented in C. The efficiency of  the solution implemented as part of this project must be compared against IdxJoin on a variety of provided inputs (𝜖, 𝑘, datasets).

## Approach and Methodology

The algorithm implemented as part of this project is the Basic Inverted Index-Based Approach  proposed by the authors in their research.  It is named All-Pairs-0 and appears in Figure 1. in the paper.

## Algorithm Design and Implementation

The implemented algorithm (InvertedIdx) is in file findsim/invertedidx.cpp and has been set as the default mode of execution. All other files in findsim have been given by Prof. David C. Anastasiu. The command to execute the findsim program in invertedidx mode is

  <p align="center">../build/findsim -m iidx -eps 0.3 -k 10 wiki1.csr wiki1.iidx.0.3.10.csr <br>Or<br>../build/findsim -eps 0.3 -k 10 wiki1.csr wiki1.iidx.0.3.10.csr <br>Or<br>../build/findsim wiki1.csr wiki1.iidx.0.3.10.csr

General usage and options of findsim command can be found in [here](https://github.com/sowmyagowri/Speed-up-APSS/blob/master/findsim/README)

A python script has been written to execute both the algorithms for all the below mentioned combinations and is available in findsim/scripts/test_script.py. This script also runs the findsim command in eq mode and displays the differences, if any, between the two output files.

* 𝜖 ∈ {0.3,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.9}
* 𝑘 ∈ {10,50,100} and 
* datasets ∈ {wiki1.csr, wiki2.csr}
